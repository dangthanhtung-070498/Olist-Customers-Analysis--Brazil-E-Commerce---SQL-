● Objective: Leverage SQL to analyze Olist's massive customer data, extracting business insights about the e-commerce platform.

● Data: Public Brazilian e-commerce dataset containing 100,000 orders (2016-2018) across various Brazilian marketplaces. 
The data offers a multi-dimensional view of orders, encompassing order status, price, payment and shipping details, customer location, 
product attributes, and customer reviews. This data is spread across 9 smaller tables.

● Techniques: SQL for data analysis and insight generation. Tableau for data visualization.

● Results:

High-Performing Regions: 

_ South and Southeast regions emerged as highly profitable, concentrated with frequent buyers purchasing large quantities. 

_ These customers experience fast deliveries with relatively low shipping costs and overall satisfaction with service. 

_ São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Paraná stand out as the top performers in this cluster.

Low-Performing Regions: 

_ Northern and Northwestern regions displayed low buyer and seller concentration, coupled with high shipping costs and extended delivery times. 

_ Roraima, Alagoas, and Maranhão emerged as the most concerning regions, 
easily differentiated by average delivery exceeding three weeks 
and consistently low customer review scores compared to other areas.
